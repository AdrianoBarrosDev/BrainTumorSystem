# BrainTumorSystem

This repository contains a brain tumor detection system using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system is designed to analyze magnetic resonance (MRI) images of human brains, identifying and locating tumors, such as gliomas, and soon other types of neoplasms. Using pre-trained models like YOLO and frameworks such as PyTorch, the project aims to assist in the automated analysis of medical images, providing a useful tool for healthcare professionals in the early diagnosis and monitoring of brain tumors.

Requirements:
• Python 3.8.10
• PyTorch
• OpenCV
• Matplotlib
• YOLOv5 (or YOLO version as per the project configuration)
